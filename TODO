about dialog: update copyright person/year
about dialog: artwork has "placeholder"

Undo/redo are clickable, even before starting a game

The first number of a game is not updated on the screen before the selector is moved to a different place.

The ingame Help: (I like it!)
  Should maybe have different name. Help is the common word for opening the help manual.
  Left align the text
  Perhaps start with a general description of the method, instead of repeating the same sentence for each line.

mcatanzaro: Too confusing in general:
 * 9 is the only possibility in 2, 0.  What is 2, 0? It's only obvious that
   they're coordinates to a technical user, and even then, are we counting from
   the top-left (computer programmer style) or the bottom left (which is what
   most other people will try)
 * Just saying "naked subset" three times in a row is confusing. You have to
   mouse over the text to see anything, and even then there's no explanation of
   what it is.

Currently we only read sudokus from data files:
  We need to complete the port of SudokuGenerator class to be able to generate sudokus as desired.

Port fullscreen mode feature, highlighter feature

mcatanzaro: We're removing Fullscreen from most other games because it usually
            looks pretty bad. Games maximized with the header bar usually fit
            nicely against the top bar of the shell, which is probably
            sufficient. I'm also not sure if highlighter is really desirable.

Known Bugs -
- Once the number pad is brought up, it does not get hidden unless a button on it is clicked
  (http://i.imgur.com/FDLukf2.png)
  Will be resolved when the Popup window is replaced by popover

mcatanzaro: This number pad was from an earlier design; I think we can remove
            it completely.

- The preview window does not resize to it's original size (the size at startup) after 'New Game' is clicked.

- Sudoku master has total 19 menu options (8 in 'Game', 5 in 'Settings', 4 in 'Tools', 2 in 'Help')
  Current vala-port design and mockups have only one panel menu and it cannot accomodate all the 19 options
  Ask aday about this.

- Mockups have alloted a separate place for notes.
  This is totally different than the current design (top, bottom notes for each cell).
  Ask aday about this.

- No icon is displayed in panel for vala-port

- Message Dialogs haven't been ported. Port gtk_goodies/dialog_extras.py

- Are translations working? I think translations are probably not working, don't we need to bindtextdomain etc?
